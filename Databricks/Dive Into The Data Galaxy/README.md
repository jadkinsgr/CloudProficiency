# **üöÄ Dive into the Data Galaxy: Quick Follow Along Options**

Welcome to the exciting world of databricks! We've got some fantastic quick lessons that will turn you into a Databricks maestro in no time. Let the data adventure begin!

- *Special note: at the conclusion of each work session - make sure to stop or terminate your clusters. This will save the company cloud computing costs. Cluster creation is covered below and if you have any questions feel free to reach out to¬†[business.joshadkins@gmail.com](mailto:business.joshadkins@gmail.com).
- *Special note two: Databricks is case sensitive. So if you hit an error check out the case styling!

## **üìä Lesson Highlights:**

5. [**Setting up user security**](https://scribehow.com/shared/Azure_Databricks__User_Security_Setup__wRL9rRwjR_6LGx5FWWiCLg) - so developers have all rights, and end-users can only see or interact with silver or gold layer tables.
6. [**Import Notebooks**](https://scribehow.com/shared/Import_a_notebook_within_Databricks_from_an_existing_file__8pC4pSM4Q9C_QpTEKEzYyg?referrer=documents)¬†- Import notebooks at a click of a button rather then manually writing them.
7. [**Export Notebooks**](https://scribehow.com/shared/Export_a_notebook_to_share_with_others__7YN5mDp3SwCZTFFoJOh8xg?referrer=documents) - share your notebook with others by exporting its contents

These quick lessons are designed for speed - breaking up the individual tasks into bite sized components that are 5 minutes or less, but don't worry if something is missing - we are adding to it all the time.

Also keep in mind - this is an illustration on the Hive Metastore - not Unity Catalog (UC). UC as of 1/1/2024 - is still in private preview. However as of this moment one notebook = one catalog. If Bronze, Silver, Gold is in different catalogs you cannot use one notebook to publish to all three. However, the workaround to this is to place the medallion architecture at the table level which is recommended by Databricks. A example is placed below in Extras.

[**Welcome Start Here:**](https://youtu.be/rRABFbz8wbw)¬†There are two training pathways - both are valuable but you can chose which to follow or do both.

**Option 1**: Hive Metastore (Legacy) - This creates bronze/silver/gold tables assuming no schema inference and shows you how to convert datatypes in the pipeline.

**Option2**: This is the Unity Catalog Approach (future): Where we inherit datatypes from the source and ingest data from ADLS Gen2 storage rather than DBFS (Databricks File System)

## **Setup Videos:**

1. [**Cluster/Compute Creation Video:**](https://youtu.be/Uz3z9bT73iI)¬†Join the guide to create your first cluster on Databricks.

2. [**Table Creation Video:**](https://youtu.be/3As9Zdi09gU)¬†¬†Create a fake source file for us to create our pipeline. - [**Synthea Patient File**](https://github.com/jadkinsgr/CloudProficiency/blob/main/Databricks/Dive%20Into%20The%20Data%20Galaxy/SyntheaFiles/patients.csv)



## **Hive MetaStore (Legacy) - Option 1:**
### Source Creation Files can be found here:
[**Synthea Patient Files**](https://github.com/jadkinsgr/CloudProficiency/blob/main/Databricks/Dive%20Into%20The%20Data%20Galaxy/SyntheaFiles/patients.csv)

1. [**Create your Bronze Table:**](https://youtu.be/TvWr-3RIons)¬†Create your starter table that contains everything
2. [**Create your Silver Table:**](https://youtu.be/fXZzzZLe4Lk)¬†: Create your table that possibly has some data type changes, column generation and constraints. 
3. [**Create your Error Logging Table:**](https://youtu.be/fiOnB1nBJnk): At the silver level we had a constraint that would catch data quality issues and drop the row. In this example we are collecting those issues in one location for easy UAT or quality review.  
4. [**Create your Gold Table:**](https://youtu.be/PmxK9MF5wq0)¬†Create your reporting table - this is what data scientists, business intelligence analysts would use.
5. [**Create your Delta Live Pipeline:**](https://youtu.be/lBriuE3urhE)¬†This runs the data through the pipeline from source, to bronze, to silver and to gold.


## **Unity Catalog (future)- Option 2:**

    **Pipeline Steps:**  
    - **1.** Creating a bronze table  
    - **2.** Creating a silver prep (data quality enforcement step)  
    - **3.** Creating a silver Type 1 SCD table  
    - **4.** Creating a silver Type 2 SCD table  
    - **5.** Creating a final gold-level reporting table  
    - **6.** Creating the pipeline ‚Äì wrapping steps 1-5 together  

    **Example Scenarios You‚Äôll Encounter:**  
    - Loading the initial set of values  
    - Adding new values (but not ones from step 1)  
    - Correcting a value from step 2  
    - Running the pipeline with "bad" data (quality check enforcement)  
    - Illustrating schema drift  
    - Handling unexpected values (e.g., a string when an integer is expected)  

    **Full Pipeline Example ‚Äì Bronze to Gold:**

    Bypass the need to retrieve data from Azure Data Factory or AWS Glue‚Äîconnect directly from Databricks!  

    - Create your Key Vault secret  
    - Set up a Databricks secret scope using Key Vault properties  
    - Assign the secret to a variable to bring everything together
